    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);  // 100, 100
    age = 200;  // changing the original value will not impact the age2 value.
    console.log(age, age2);  // 200, 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);

    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];    

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // team is a reference to the original array (which was players.)
    // if you update an array it will always reference back.
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();  // slice() returns the entire array when you pass in nothing.
    console.log(players, team2);

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // A spread will take every item out of your iterable and put it into the containing array/function.
    const team4 = [...players];
    console.log(players, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'hee haw'
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    console.log(team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
        name: 'Wes Box',
        age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;  // This makes a reference!  Not a copy.
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);


    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    };
    console.log(wes);

    // make a copy of wes
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // Object.assign only does one level deep.  Should use clone to deep copy.

    // One hacky way to do a deep clone this is to copy the object.
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
